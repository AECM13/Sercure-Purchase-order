Secure Purchase order

The purpose of this code is to create an implementation of a secure purchase order system using Python's criptographic libraries.
the implementation is divided in two scripts. A signing script and a verification script.

Signing a file:
A file is digested into the hash function(SHA512) to create the hash of the file.
A timestamp including the date and time is add to the hash as a proof of integrity.
the hash is signed using a RSA private key(2048 bits)

Verifying a file:
The file to verify is hashed using SHA512.
import the timestamp created with the signature  and add to the hash of the file.
The signature is decrypted using the public key created while signing the file.
the hashes are compared and the script will print out if the signature is valid or not.
